# Synopsys R&D Internship Application – Gururaja Gonal
Application for the R&amp;D Engineering Internship at Synopsys (Noida Office) – includes my profile, resume, relevant skills, and projects in Digital Design and verification. Contains a write-up on why I am a strong fit for the role.

## About Me
I am an Electronics and Communication Engineering undergraduate (2025 graduate) specializing in Digital Design and Verification, with strong skills in RTL design, SystemVerilog, UVM, and embedded systems. I have hands-on experience in building constrained-random verification environments and debugging at both RTL and gate levels.

## Why I Am a Good Fit
- Strong foundation in Digital and Analog electronics, ASIC design flow, FSM, and STA.
- Hands-on experience with tools like Cadence Virtuoso, ModelSim, Quartus Prime, Vivado, and Silvaco TCAD.
- Multiple completed projects in processor design, protocol implementation, and verification environments.
- Passionate about problem-solving and design verification in high-performance chip development.

## Relevant Skills
- **EDA Tools:** Cadence Virtuoso, ModelSim, Quartus Prime, Vivado, Silvaco TCAD
- **HDLs:** Verilog, SystemVerilog, UVM
- **Verification:** Constrained-Random, Coverage-Driven, Assertion-Based
- **Programming:** Python, C++
- **Other Skills:** Digital/Analog Electronics, FSM, STA

## Selected Projects
- **5-Stage Pipelined RISC-V Processor** – Designed in Verilog, verified functionality across pipeline stages.
- **SystemVerilog-Based Testbench for SPI Slave** – Complete UVM environment for protocol verification.
- **I2C and UART Protocol Implementation** – Verilog-based communication modules with efficient design.
- **Memory BIST RTL Design** – Automated memory testing architecture.
- **Double Gate Double Material TFET for Biosensing** – TCAD-based cancer detection device simulation.
